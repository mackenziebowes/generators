## Character Plans

The current character generater is good, but we can go further and add different types of characters.

### Archetype Lottery

There should be a page that, rather than trying to generate a character based on Flaws and Duties, just assigns stats, magic, origin, and ancestry to an Archetypal character https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchetypalCharacter

### Greedy for ALL the flat characters!

https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Characters This is a big page!
https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharactersAsDevice

### Changing State

I need to eat this website, but I want to come up with a plan for shifting things around.
Currently, the generators/characters/index page is built for my balanced TTRPG NPC generator.

I'd like to come up with a name for that specific system and move it deeper, and that'll break like... ~all the imports. Fuck.

Also, what name to use...? I'll just go with "Round" because it was meant to create Round characters.

### Flash of Insight - Layouts

I already parted out the page into that Bento system - I can move just the Bentos to a new page in a layouts folder and set up a big switch case on that.

- todo: use the URL bar to share/load/save view state

## Monsters! Criminals! Villains!

Games need mooks and stories need conflict. Monsters are agentic... not technically characters, but characters interact with them...
Hierarchies are lame, but I don't want to get lost in the sause here.

## More importantly... Plot points!

Plots are lines - like a wave graph, showing tension (anticipation, suspense) over time.

Lines are, of course, made of points - any two points describe a line that passes through both.
... However, I am completely overwhelmed by the sheer quantity and disorganization of plot points.

There are, maybe, [seven basic plots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seven_Basic_Plots) and one dramatic metaplot which takes the structure:

- **Anticipation Stage** where the Call of Adventure sounds and the audience is excited to see where the call goes.
- **Dream Stage** where the adventure begins and the hero has some success - feels invincible.
- **Frustration Stage** where the hero has a meaningful confrontation with the enemy - the illusion of invincibility is lost.
- **Nightmare Stage** where all hope is apparently lost.
- **Resolution** where the hero overcomes their burden against the odds.

This framing looks like booty cheeks to me - it doesn't validate or account for _any_ of the folkloric stories from Uther's index, slice of life, romance, etc. It's a crock of shit, probably.

There may be [36 dramatic situations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thirty-Six_Dramatic_Situations) which is probably also a crock of shit.

TV Tropes has identified literally hundreds of situations.

I think that's what makes a story happen, be it a serial or a slice of life or a romance or what have you. Characters always have goals and the results are more or less random - good and bad things just happen. People are crazy. Nature is weird.

### Types of points

I have to do this shit my damn self because the smart guys before me are too up their butts to figure this stuff out proper-like, with computers and shit.

Something that came up in my research is that there's a difference between story and plot.

Story is just a list of shit that happened. Telling a story means working through this list. The audience has a theatre in their mind - even when you spend all the money to animate or film some shit happening, the audience has a unique, private experience building the world and filling in the blanks.

So, therefore, you don't have to show _all_ the shit that happened. Spielburg uses cuts to weave two plots together, depends on the movie. I think the two plots are easier to weave if they're connected somehow.

#### Types of Weaves

Fundamentally, the weaves happen via shared motifs. Stupid word here, it doesn't do anything to prescribe how to actually do the weave.

There are a few categories of motif alignment in a weave.

- **Faction**: The characters in adjacent scenes are in related factions, either collaboratively or competitively. We, the audience, may discover what our hero's allies, enemies, or rivals are doing.
- **Goal**: Loosely related to factions, the motif of goals are related, but the characters may be unrelated. For example, weaving two romance stories where one is progressing well and the other isn't. Or the other one also is. Who cares. This might even be a budding couple both wanting to upgrade the relationship and having different reasons for refusing to try to, dramatic irony we are privy to due to our privileged third person perspective.
- **Images**: We all sleep under the same moon. By divorcing the narrative weave from character relationships and goals, we get to earn a Nobel Prize in writing the most boring bullshit known to man and do a LitFic character study - we are all human, after all. All cousins, all connected, all flawed - sorry, yawning.
- **Emotions**: Similar to images, but this final category is the catch-all trashcan at the bottom of the hierarchy. Weaving between a dysfunctional family dynamic with a lot of love and bruises to basically anything creates meaning in the theatre of the mind. _Those_ people were crying out in rage, _these_ people are doing... anything else, or even the same thing. Or vice versa. Going from Hot to Cold produces Bathos, going from Cold to Hot is just in media res - any juxtaposition here creates meaning, but it's randumb.

So, all that to explore and say that cutting the narrative to weave an A plot and B plot together is not plotting. That's editing - and edits can fix stupid plots. Good to know, but we're looking at generating plots - what _are_ the things we're cutting from and to?

#### Back on Track

Plot points are the big situations. Not necessarily twists - as the audience, we get to enjoy a privileged perspective, so we can see stuff coming for our characters. We either anticipate or are in suspense of certain specific things happening. However, after a plot point happens, the mood and next steps for all characters in the situation change.

So, that means a plot point involves risk, probably. A character rolls the bones and we expect something good or bad to happen to them. We may be surprised.

Now we're getting somewhere. A "proper" plot, as in a novel, movie, comic, or game, might have a list of popular plots, but we don't need to only produce those. I think it is natural to assume somebody asking the question "How do I write a plot?" might have included a parenthetical "good" somewhere in that sentence, but we are not asking that today.

#### The Good, Legal, Ministry of Plot Approved Points

This gets us to our basic list. This list is recommended to avoid triggering the Too Bleak, Stopped Caring / I don't care what happens to these people issue - purely random plots where the outcome is left up to chance has the capability of giving flat valence experiences. Too negative _and_ too positive are possibilities with procgen.

- Call to Action
- Leaving Home
- Gaining Confidence
- The Point of No Return
- Disaster
- Transformation
- Returning with the Elixir

Two complaints, here. First, this list of plots is mad short, we'll get to that later. Second, a lot of the points are interchangeable. This is a plot list that enables character growth, ie mind-fucking-control by winding us up for identifying with the hero and then telling us how to behave to get what we want, too. We don't have to finger wag as authors or game designers.

In asian cultures, there's a different structure where the story has 4 parts:

- Introduction
- Situation/Intention
- Twist/Surprise
- Resolution/Response

This is literally just an interesting situation. Some shit happens and you deal with it and that's life. This, by the way, is much shorter, and also doesn't mind-fuck the audience into believing what we want.

#### Non-negotiable parts

Stories have to at least start. At the barest minimum. We kind of expect, now, that stories continue - if we like a character, we want to keep hanging out with them and seeing what they get up to. So, big "return with the elixir" moments aren't necessary.

Stuff also has to happen. While the character doesn't need to change, they do need to learn - about the world around them, lessons in humility, lessons in confidence, gaining skill, gaining allies, losing allies, gaining money, losing money, whatever. Stuff needs to happen.

The big list of beginning tropes is here:
https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeginningTropes

Pulling my favourites for the generator immediately, here and now. These events are really meaningful, and will get a separate category in the plot generator.

- Evacuation: The character is being shuttled out of a city during an attack.
- Birthday: The character experienced a milestone birthday and will enter a new life stage. Includes the actual day of birth.
- Hometown Disaster: The hometown or base of the protagonist is destroyed somehow - natural disaster, enemy attack as in Evacuation, etc.
- Fallen Angel: Someone "falls out of the sky" into the protagonist's life.
- Falling: The protagonist "falls out of the sky" into the world - isekai transporation.
- Waking Up: The protagonist is woken up by somebody.
- The Blessing: The protagonist receives a blessing from their idol (god, hero) that gives them new confidence to achieve their goals.
- Recovery: The protagonist was injured and wakes up in the care of someone.
- Unemployment: The protagonist loses (or quits or retires from) their job, motivating them towards new experiences.
- Shipwrecked: The protagonist is shipwrecked in a new land.
- New Room: The story begins with the protagonist entering an unfamiliar place (similar to shipwrecked, just not stuck.)
- After The Adventure: The story begins dealing with the fallout from a previous adventure.

Some notes:
"Falling out of the sky" doesn't have to be literal. "Shipwrecked" is technically falling out of the sky - the idea here is that, against the character's will, they are in a new situation. In some ways, the "Evacuation" point is this - they "fall out of the sky", except out of the city and into... wherever. The new city, the country, et cetera.
Similar plot points would be:

- Drafted into Service
- Abducted and Smuggled
- Arrested and Transferred
- Crash landing from a flying machine ("Airshipwrecked" as in BG3)
- Transferred by a large organization, like a guild, company, or government
- Teleported, accidentally or not
- Stumbling upon a hidden culture
- Merely arriving as planned _for_ that character - if a side character, their Just Showing Up One Day is an unexpected event for the protagonist.

"New Room" starts are also this, in some regards:

- Accepted into a new organization: "Falling out of" the Outsiders into the Inner Circle, ie First day of school, new job, new assignment, arriving to the front lines
- Exiled from an organization: "Fallout out of" the Inner Circle and into the Outsiders - but the roles are reversed. The old organization are now the Outsiders, and the character has a new Inner Circle to join. This is also the _fired_ variant of the "Unemployed" start.

So, we can make some broad categories.

- Your New Home: The protagonist fell out of the sky somehow. Subcategories: Willingly, Unwillingly, Intentionally, Accidentally, Happily, Unhappily.
- A Fresh Face: A side character fell out of the sky somehow. Subcategories: Willingly, Unwillingly, Intentionally, Accidentally, Happily, Unhappily.

There remains:

- Birthday
- Waking Up
- The Blessing
- Recovery
- After the Adventure

"Waking Up" and "Recovery" are nearly identical, just one is more action-oriented and high stakes. Broadly, these two and one of the After the Adventure type starts are under one umbrella.

- An Otherwise Normal Day: The _story_ (not plot) begins with a normal day. Subcategories: Low Stakes, High Stakes, Happily, Unhappily.

This start is useful for presenting characterization early and introducing "the normal world" before the inciting event actually happens. It is not a plot point. It can probably be mixed with a plot point somehow - for example, if the "Normal Day" includes a chase or fight sequence, the result of the chase or fight changes the mood of the characters and redefines what their logical actions are, making the chase or fight a plot point.

Birthday, The Blessing, and the rest of After the Adventure ideas compose another umbrella category.

- A Red Letter Day: _This_ day is extra important somehow. Subcategories: Time (Birthdays, New Month, New Year, otherwise agreed upon & planned status quo change), Touched by Greatness (Subvariants: Positive, Negative, ie Visited by the Saintess, Summoned by the Church, Visited by a Demon General, etc).

Technically, "After the Adventure" happening _as_ the heroes return home qualify as Your New Home - the "sky" from which they fell was the out-of-media adventure.

**Summary**
There are 4 fundamental ways to begin a story.
Three of them are plot points:

- Your New Home
- A Fresh Face
- Red Letter Day

One of them is not, but still a strong choice:

- An Otherwise Normal Day

#### What kind of stuff happens?

Here's the big list of plot points. These are the situations where the characters are forced to roll bones and accept the outcome. My mythical plot points.

Let me brainstorm a list of stuff that happens.

## Stuff that happens

Duh, you verb nouns. There are 4 broad categories of things the "noun" could be: Place, Information, Agent, Item.

Information is probably the largest category; it could include processes, societal structures, etiquette, but also schemes, threats, et cetera.

I use the term Agent to include a person, people writ large, an animal, a species, etc. Anything that has agency is a Character, but some Characters are merely Mooks.

To turn this into a plot point, we just add valence x intensity:

Stakes:
Lowest, Lower, Normal, Higher, Highest

Valence:
Positive / Negative

### The Character Discovers a:

- New Place
- New Information
- New Agent
- New Item

### The Character Loses:

- A Place
- An Agent
- An Item
- Status

(Hard to lose information. The Audience will remember, Chekov's gun et cetera.)

### The Character Gains:

- Access to a New Place
- New Information
- A relationship with a New Agent
- A New Item
- Status

### Procedural and Dramatic Beats

The above system composes something called Procedural Beats - shit actually happening in the world.

People also require, for flavour and breathers, Dramatic Beats. That uses a different system than [verb] [noun] [stakes] [valence].

### The Character Earns (val <= 0 -> val >= 0):

- Trust
- Bond
- Loyalty
- Respect

### The Character Deepens (val++):

- Trust
- Bond
- Understanding
- Loyalty
- Respect

### The Character Weakens (val--):

- Trust
- Bond
- Understanding
- Loyalty
- Respect

### The Character Destroys (val >= 0 -> val <= 0):

- Trust
- Bond
- Loyalty
- Respect
